Me: Mate, help me out. Showing this error “IndentationError: unexpected indent” in Colab. How to fix it?
AI: It usually happens when your code uses a mix of spaces and tabs for indentation. Python requires consistency.

Me: But what is wrong? I can’t mix them in the same file?
AI: Exactly. You should use only spaces, preferably four per level. In Colab, you can select all and choose “Convert indentations to spaces.”

Me: Ah, ok mate. That’s why some cells ran fine and others failed. I’ll fix it all.
AI: Perfect. Once all indents are consistent, the errors will disappear.

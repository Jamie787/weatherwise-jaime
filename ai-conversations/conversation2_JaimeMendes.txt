Me: Mate, I’m trying to get the temperature value from the weather API, but data['temperature'] it is not working out?
AI: The correct path might depend on the API structure. Try accessing data['current_weather']['temperature'].

Me: Ah okay, mate. It means it’s inside current weather function?
AI: Yes, exactly. You can print(data.keys()) first to see what’s inside each dictionary level.

Me: Thanks, mate. Now I can do it correctly.
AI: Perfect. You can also add 'units=m' in your request to make sure it’s metric.

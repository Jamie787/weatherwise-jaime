Me: Mate, wish and need to compare the two cities (Perth and Lisbon). How does it work to show the temperature, wind, and sunrise/sunset?
AI: You can store the city names in a list and use a for loop to call the API for each one.

Me: Do you mean something like this? for city in ['Perth', 'Lisbon']?
AI: Exactly. Then print each city’s results separately for better readability.

Me: Done, mate. It is working for both cities.
AI: Nice work — that’s a clean way to handle multiple API calls.

Me: Ok, thanks mate.

Me: Mate, my code keeps printing the same error message twice when I call the function?-see above.
AI: That usually happens if both the main function and the calling cell print the same message.

Me: I’m using if isinstance(weather_response, str)... maybe it’s printing twice there?
AI: Try adding a check like if weather_response.startswith("Error:"): return None after printing once.

Me: Mate, dome. It is working. Now the error shows only one time. Many thanks. :)
AI: Perfect. Clean and readable error handling.

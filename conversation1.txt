AI Conversation Log #1: Developing the Weather Data Retrieval Function
===========================================================================

Date: October 12, 2025
Tool: Claude AI
Purpose: Implementing the get_weather_data() function with proper error handling

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 1 (Initial Request):
I need to create a function called get_weather_data() that retrieves weather information 
for a location using the fetch-my-weather package. The function should accept a location 
string and number of forecast days (1-5), and return a structured dictionary with current 
conditions and forecast data.

RESPONSE 1:
[AI provided a basic implementation that used get_weather() but didn't properly structure 
the data or handle all edge cases]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 2 (Refinement - Adding Structure):
The response structure needs improvement. I need the function to:
1. Extract current conditions (temp, feels_like, humidity, wind, precipitation, UV index, weather description)
2. Extract area information (location name, country, region)
3. Extract forecast data with daily max/min/avg temperatures and hourly breakdowns
4. Return None if there's an error, not just print an error message
5. Handle both Pydantic model responses and error strings

Can you revise the function to properly extract and structure all this data from the 
fetch-my-weather response?

RESPONSE 2:
[AI provided improved version with better data extraction but was missing validation 
for forecast_days parameter]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 3 (Adding Validation):
Good progress! However, I noticed the function doesn't validate the forecast_days parameter.
It should:
- Ensure forecast_days is between 1 and 5
- Use max/min to clamp the value if it's out of range
- This prevents API errors from invalid parameters

Also, add comprehensive docstrings explaining all parameters and return values.

RESPONSE 3:
[AI added parameter validation using max(1, min(5, forecast_days)) and improved docstrings]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 4 (Error Handling Enhancement):
The error handling could be more robust. Update the function to:
1. Check if the response is an error string (starts with "Error:")
2. Handle cases where response attributes might be None or empty
3. Use hasattr() to safely check for attributes before accessing them
4. Add a try-except block around the entire function

RESPONSE 4:
[AI added comprehensive error handling with try-except, hasattr checks, and proper 
error string detection]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EVALUATION:
The final function successfully:
✅ Retrieves weather data from the API
✅ Validates input parameters
✅ Structures data into a clean dictionary format
✅ Handles errors gracefully
✅ Extracts current conditions, area info, and forecasts
✅ Processes hourly data for each forecast day
✅ Returns None on failure instead of raising exceptions

This iterative refinement process demonstrates intentional prompting by:
- Starting with a clear goal
- Identifying specific gaps in each response
- Requesting targeted improvements
- Building complexity gradually
- Ensuring robust error handling

The function is now production-ready and handles edge cases properly.

- [x] Sections are logically organised and follow the required structure
- [x] Code includes appropriate comments and docstrings
- [x] No unused code or unnecessary cells
- [x] All imports are at the top of the notebook or in the appropriate section

## Weather Data Component

- [x] Successfully retrieves weather data from chosen source (fetch-my-weather)
- [x] Handles connection errors and timeouts gracefully
- [x] Validates user input (e.g., city names, forecast_days parameter)
- [x] Processes and structures the data for use in the application
- [x] Provides meaningful error messages for users

## Visualisation Component

- [x] Implements 3 different visualisation types (temperature, precipitation, combined)
- [x] All visualisations have proper titles, labels, and legends
- [x] Visualisations are readable and use appropriate colors
- [x] Handles edge cases (e.g., missing data, extreme values)
- [x] Visualisations are relevant to the data being displayed

## Natural Language Interface

- [x] Successfully parses user questions to extract key information
- [x] Identifies locations in user queries using regex patterns
- [x] Identifies time periods in user queries (current, tomorrow, this week, etc.)
- [x] Identifies weather attributes (temperature, rain, wind, humidity, etc.)
- [x] Generates natural-sounding responses to user questions
- [x] Provides contextual, actionable advice

## User Interface

- [x] Implements a clear menu system using pyinputplus
- [x] Provides appropriate feedback to users (status messages, errors)
- [x] Has a logical flow between different options
- [x] Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- [x] Maintains a clean and organised display with emojis

## AI Interaction Documentation

- [x] At least 5 significant AI conversations documented (5 complete conversations)
- [x] Conversations saved as text files in the ai-conversations/ directory
- [x] Demonstrates multiple intentional prompting techniques:
  - Incremental refinement
  - Specific, targeted requests
  - Explanation requests
  - Edge case identification
  - Before-after comparisons
- [x] Before/after examples included showing code improvement
- [x] Clear demonstration of iterative development process

## Technical Requirements

- [x] All code runs without errors (tested locally)
- [x] No hardcoded sensitive data (API keys, personal information)
- [x] Modular design with functions for specific tasks
- [x] Appropriate error handling throughout the application
- [x] Code follows consistent style (PEP 8, naming conventions)

## Final Testing

- [x] Tested with multiple locations (London, Paris, Tokyo, etc.)
- [x] Tested with various types of weather questions
- [x] Tested with edge cases (invalid locations, connection issues)
- [x] All menu options function as expected
- [x] Visualisations render correctly
- [x] Comprehensive test suite included in notebook

## Documentation Quality

- [x] Code is well-commented with meaningful docstrings
- [x] README.md provides clear overview and instructions
- [x] AI conversation logs show thoughtful interaction
- [x] Reflection document (600+ words) included
- [x] All required files are present and properly formatted

## Submission

- [x] Final version of notebook saved to repository
- [x] All AI conversation files included (5 conversations + before-after)
- [x] Reflection document completed
- [ ] Repository link submitted through LMS (TO BE DONE BY STUDENT)

## Extra Credit Achieved

- [x] Implemented additional features beyond basic requirements:
  - Combined dashboard visualization
  - AI-enhanced responses using hands-on-ai
  - Helper functions for weather summary formatting
  - Comprehensive error handling system
  
- [x] Created especially innovative visualisations:
  - Color-coded precipitation chart with risk levels
  - Filled area between temperature extremes
  - Combined multi-panel dashboard
  
- [x] Developed advanced natural language understanding capabilities:
  - Multiple regex patterns for location extraction
  - Context-aware response generation
  - Activity recommendations based on weather
  - Question type identification (query/recommendation/prediction)
  
- [x] Demonstrated exceptional intentional prompting techniques:
  - Documented 5 complete AI conversation logs
  - Showed iterative refinement over multiple cycles
  - Created detailed before-after examples
  - Explained prompting strategies explicitly

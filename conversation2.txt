AI Conversation Log #2: Creating Data Visualizations
======================================================

Date: October 12, 2025
Tool: Claude AI
Purpose: Developing temperature and precipitation visualization functions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 1 (Initial Request):
I need to create two visualization functions:
1. create_temperature_visualisation() - shows temperature trends
2. create_precipitation_visualisation() - shows precipitation chances

Both should accept weather_data dict and output_type parameter ('display' or 'figure').
Use matplotlib for plotting.

RESPONSE 1:
[AI provided basic line plot for temperature and simple bar chart for precipitation,
but visuals were bland and lacked proper formatting]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 2 (Enhancing Visual Appeal):
The visualizations work but need to be more professional and informative. Please enhance them to:

For temperature visualization:
- Plot max, min, AND average temperatures (not just max/min)
- Use distinct colors: red tones for max, blue/green for min, teal for average
- Add a filled area between min and max temperatures
- Include markers on each data point
- Add a grid for easier reading
- Format dates properly on x-axis
- Make the title include the location name

For precipitation visualization:
- Use color coding: blue for low risk (<30%), orange for moderate (30-60%), red for high (>60%)
- Add horizontal threshold lines at 30% and 60%
- Set y-axis limits to 0-100%
- Make bars narrower for better visibility when there are many hours
- Add proper date/time formatting on x-axis

RESPONSE 2:
[AI improved both visualizations with color coding, better formatting, and labels,
but date formatting was still not optimal]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 3 (Fixing Date Formatting):
The date formatting needs improvement. Use matplotlib.dates module:
- Import mdates from matplotlib
- Use DateFormatter for readable date labels (e.g., "Oct 12")
- Use DayLocator for major ticks
- Rotate x-axis labels 45 degrees for readability
- For precipitation chart, add HourLocator with 6-hour intervals for minor ticks

RESPONSE 3:
[AI added proper date formatting using mdates, making charts much more readable]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROMPT 4 (Enhancing Professionalism):
Final touches needed:
1. Make titles bold and increase font size to 14pt
2. Make axis labels bold and size 12pt
3. Add legends with framealpha=0.9 for semi-transparency
4. Use tight_layout() to prevent label cutoff
5. Increase figure sizes: (12, 6) for temperature, (14, 6) for precipitation
6. Add descriptive legend labels like "Max Temperature" instead of just "Max"

RESPONSE 4:
[AI added all professional touches, resulting in publication-quality visualizations]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BONUS PROMPT (Additional Feature):
Can you create a third function called create_combined_visualisation() that shows 
both temperature and precipitation in a single figure using subplots? This would 
be useful for a dashboard view.

RESPONSE:
[AI created combined visualization with 2 rows, sharing x-axis, providing 
comprehensive weather overview]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EVALUATION:
The final visualization functions successfully:
✅ Create professional, publication-quality charts
✅ Use appropriate color coding for data interpretation
✅ Handle date/time formatting properly
✅ Include helpful gridlines and legends
✅ Support both display and figure return modes
✅ Handle edge cases (no data available)
✅ Provide comprehensive weather insights

Key improvements through intentional prompting:
- Started with basic functionality
- Incrementally added visual enhancements
- Fixed specific formatting issues
- Added professional touches
- Extended with additional features

The visualizations now effectively communicate weather patterns and make 
data interpretation intuitive for users.
